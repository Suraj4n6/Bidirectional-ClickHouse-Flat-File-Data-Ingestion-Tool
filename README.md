# Data Ingestion Tool using FastAPI and ClickHouse

## Project Overview
This project implements a data ingestion tool that uses FastAPI for the backend and ClickHouse for storing and retrieving data. It allows bidirectional data flow between flat files and a ClickHouse database.

## Features
- FastAPI-based backend for handling data requests.
- Integration with ClickHouse for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Frontend interface (React) to interact with the backend.
  
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- FastAPI
- ClickHouse database
- React (for frontend)

## Setup Instructions
### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone hhttps://github.com/Suraj4n6/DataWrangler1234
# Data Ingestion Tool

This project is a web-based data ingestion tool that facilitates bidirectional data flow between ClickHouse and flat files. It includes both a FastAPI backend and a React frontend for interacting with the data.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (for the frontend)
- npm (for managing frontend packages)
- ClickHouse (set up the database if not already done)

## Backend Setup

1. **Install required Python libraries:**

   Navigate to the backend directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data Ingestion Tool
A tool for ingesting and processing data with ClickHouse, FastAPI backend, and a frontend interface.
Setup Instructions
Backend Setup

## Set up ClickHouse database:
If the ClickHouse database is not already set up, please follow the ClickHouse setup documentation to configure it.
## Run the FastAPI server:
Start the FastAPI server with the following command:
uvicorn main:app --reload
This will start the backend server, typically accessible at http://localhost:8000.

## Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:
Move to the frontend folder:
bashcd frontend

## Install necessary npm packages:
Run the following command to install the required npm packages:
bashnpm install

## Start the frontend server:
To start the frontend development server, run:
bashnpm start
This will launch the frontend, usually accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Running the Application
Ensure both the backend and frontend servers are running:

# Backend: http://localhost:8000
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Open the frontend in your browser and interact with the data ingestion tool.
